# Dr. Srikanth Baride
_Postdoctoral Researcher, University of South Dakota • AI & Reinforcement Learning_

I design algorithms that make learning **sample-efficient and reliable**—from **world models** in RL to **pattern mining** for real data. I enjoy building things end-to-end: theory → code → impact.

**Focus:** Reinforcement Learning • World Models • Data Mining  
**Prev:** Digital Innovation Engineer (Buckman) • Systems Engineer (Infosys)
