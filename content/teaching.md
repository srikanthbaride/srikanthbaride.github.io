I have designed and taught graduate‑level courses, and mentored theses/capstones in:

- **Applied Reinforcement Learning**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Data Mining**
- **Distributed Systems**

**Approach:** tight **theory ↔ practice** loop with coding labs, open‑source repos, and reproducible experiments.
