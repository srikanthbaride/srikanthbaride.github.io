I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in Computer Science at the **University of South Dakota**. After completing my Ph.D. at **IIIT Delhi** in 2024, I have focused my research on **Reinforcement Learning** and **Spatial Data Mining**, developing algorithms that are both theoretically sound and practically impactful.

My work spans applied AI research in healthcare and industry, and I currently contribute to a federally funded research program where methodological rigour, external funding readiness and real‑world impact are paramount.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, energy-efficient AI systems,
and scalable pattern mining over spatial and large-scale data.
I work at the intersection of learning theory, sustainable AI,
and real-world AI deployment.

- Reinforcement learning and decision-making systems
- Carbon-aware and energy-efficient AI (AI-CARE)
- Spatial data mining and colocation pattern analysis
- Safe and uncertainty-aware AI deployment
