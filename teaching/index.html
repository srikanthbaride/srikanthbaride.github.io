<h1>Teaching</h1>
<p>My teaching philosophy centers on creating a strong theory‑practice loop. I structure my courses to provide a clear conceptual foundation, followed by hands‑on projects that encourage students to apply what they’ve learned to real‑world problems. This approach cultivates critical thinking and prepares students for research or professional work.</p>
<h2>Graduate Courses at the University of South Dakota (USD)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CSC 547 Artificial Intelligence</strong> – Graduate-level survey of AI fundamentals including search, knowledge representation, planning, and learning. Students implement classical algorithms and examine ethical considerations of AI.</li>
    <li><strong>CSC 724 Applied Reinforcement Learning</strong> – Focuses on the principles and applications of RL. Students learn both model-based and model-free methods and complete programming assignments culminating in a mini research project.</li>
    <li><strong>CSC 792 Topics in Advanced Data Mining</strong> – Advanced seminar exploring state‑of‑the‑art techniques for mining complex datasets (spatial, spatiotemporal, graphs). Students read research papers and conduct a project applying algorithms to real data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Assistant / Co-Instructor Courses at USD</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CSC 785 Information Storage & Retrieval</strong> – Covers text indexing, search engines, and evaluation metrics. Students build search systems and evaluate them using standard IR datasets.</li>
    <li><strong>CSC 787 AI in Medical Imaging</strong> – Introduces radiomics, medical image analysis, and deep learning for clinical tasks. Students apply Python tools to classify imaging data and explore fairness and robustness issues.</li>
